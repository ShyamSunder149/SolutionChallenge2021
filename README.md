## Problem Statement
In India,Farmer's are not facing the profit that they deserve and suffering from loan debts and interference of middlman who acts as a mediator between farmers and the market as middleman buys the goods from the farmer at a very low cost and sells it in the market at a highly profitable rate.

## Solution Idea
To Solve the above problem statement, Instead of having a middleman, farmers and users can interact directly by this app So that the farmers can decide their own rate for the thing what they produced and can make them earn profit.

## Solution Description
Farmer can listout the following things:
*What they are willing to sell*,
*The amount of quantity*,
*Price for the product*,
*Description of the Product* and
*Contact of the farmer*

The user can look at the listings posted and they can buy directly from the farmer using the contact information provided in the listing.

## Benefits of the solution:
Consumer can buy what they wish to buy and we provide them a platform to compare rates and buy at their own comfortable rate.
Farmers can sell their product at a price where they can earn a reasonable amount of profit.
This app will be beneficial for both the parties (consumer and farmers).
The main motive is to make farmer earn more for what they have worked for and the elimination of middleman.
